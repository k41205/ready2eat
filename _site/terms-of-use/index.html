  <h1 class="terms__title">Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Welcome to Ready2Eat. This page (together with the documents referred to in
    it) tells you the terms (the “Terms”) which apply when you order any menu
    items (the "Items") from our ready2eat.netlify.app website or mobile
    applications and related services (each referred to as an “Application”).
    Please read these Terms carefully before ordering any Items from our
    Application. If you have any questions relating to these Terms please
    contact support@ready2eat.netlify.app before you place an order. If you are
    a consumer, you have certain legal rights when you order Items using our
    Application. You can find more information about these rights at:
    https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/
    and from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC),
    https://www.ccpc.ie. Your legal rights are not affected by these Terms,
    which apply in addition to them and do not replace them. By setting up your
    Ready2Eat account, you confirm that you accept these Terms.
  </p>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">1. Information About Us</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Ready2Eat Ireland Limited is a company incorporated and registered in
    Ireland, with a registered office at Cork Rd, Waterford, Ireland. Our
    Company registration number is 123456. Our VAT number is 123456789A. You may
    contact us at support@ready2eat.netlify.app or by using the instant
    messaging facility on our Application.
  </p>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">2. Purpose</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Our objective is to link you to the restaurants we partner with (“Partner
    Restaurants") and allow you to order Items for delivery (our “Service”).
    Where you order from a Partner Restaurant, Ready2Eat acts as an agent on
    behalf of that Partner Restaurant to conclude your order from our
    Application and to manage your experience throughout the order process. Once
    you have placed an order, delivery of your Items will be arranged by
    Ready2Eat (“Ready2Eat Delivery”) or our Partner Restaurant (“Partner
    Delivery) (each a “Delivery”) depending on the Partner Restaurant you have
    selected. In some cases, the Partner Restaurant may be owned by or
    affiliated with us.
  </p>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">3. Your Account</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Before you can place orders for Items using our Application, you need to
    open a Ready2Eat account. When you open an account you may create a
    password, or other secure login method, and may also have to provide credit
    card details. You must keep any password you create, or other secure login
    method, secret, and prevent others from accessing your email account or
    mobile phone. If another person uses these methods to access your account,
    you will be responsible to pay for any Items they order, and we are not
    responsible for any other losses you suffer, unless the person using your
    password obtained it because we did not keep it secure.
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    You may close your account at any time by requesting to do so in your
    account section of our website or contacting us using the contact details
    above. We may suspend your access to your account, or close it permanently,
    if we believe that your account has been used by someone else. We may also
    close your account if in our opinion you are abusing our Service (for
    example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you
    are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating our staff
    or riders, or any other good reason). If we close your account permanently
    we will refund any remaining account credit you have validly obtained from
    our customer service team or Application following any issue with an order,
    by applying a credit to your registered credit card, or if that is not
    possible for any reason, by way of a bank transfer using bank details
    (provided you have supplied them to us).
  </p>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">4. Service Availability</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Each Partner Restaurant has a prescribed delivery area. This delivery area
    may change at any time due to factors such as weather, or demand on our
    service. This is to ensure that Items reach your door at their best. Our
    Partner Restaurants each decide their own operating hours. That means that
    the availability of our Service, and the range of Partner Restaurants from
    which you can order, depends on the Partner Restaurants in your area. If you
    try to order a delivery to a location outside the delivery area or operating
    hours of a Partner Restaurant, or the Application is otherwise unavailable
    for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible.
  </p>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">5. Orders</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    When you place an order through our Application, it needs to be accepted by
    us or the Partner Restaurant before it is confirmed. We will send you a
    notification if your order has been accepted (the "Confirmation Notice").
    The contract for the supply of any Item you have ordered comes into
    existence when we send the Confirmation Notice. You are responsible for
    paying for all Items ordered using your account, and for related delivery
    charges, and for complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered the
    Item for someone else. Some Partner Restaurants operate a minimum order
    value policy. This will be displayed on our Application. All Items are
    subject to availability. Partner Restaurants may use nuts or other allergens
    in the preparation of certain Items. Please contact our Partner Restaurant
    prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Ready2Eat cannot guarantee that
    any of the Items sold by our Partner Restaurants are free of allergens.
  </p>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">6. Delivery</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    When you place an order you will have the choice to place it as an ASAP
    Delivery or a Scheduled Delivery. For an ASAP Delivery, we will tell you an
    estimated delivery time for your Item before you place the order, but we
    will attempt delivery as soon as possible; you must therefore be available
    to accept delivery from the time you place the order. For a Scheduled
    Delivery, we will tell you the time when the Item is expected to be
    delivered; you must be available to accept delivery for ten minutes before
    and ten minutes after that time.
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Unfortunately, despite our, and our Partner Restaurant’s best efforts,
    things do not always go to plan and factors such as traffic and weather
    conditions may prevent us from delivering your Item on time. If your order
    is more than 15 minutes late, and we haven’t notified you giving you the
    option to cancel your order, we will work with you to make things right
    unless you have caused the delay (e.g. because you gave us the wrong address
    or did not come to the door).
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    We will attempt delivery at the address you provide to us when you place
    your order. If you need to change the delivery location after you have
    placed your order, we may be able to change to the address to an alternative
    one that is registered with your account if you let us know before the rider
    has been dispatched, and the new address is within the same zone as the
    address you originally ordered your Item to. If we cannot change the
    delivery address, you have the option to cancel the order, but if food
    preparation has started you will be charged the full price for the Item, and
    if the rider has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    You will still be charged for the Item and for delivery in the event of a
    failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons you
    might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to):
  </p>
  <ul class="terms__text">
    <li>
      You do not come to the door, did not pick up the phone when the rider
      contacted you using the contact information you have provided us and/or
      you picked up the phone but then failed to provide access within a
      reasonable amount of time, and the rider is unable to find a safe location
      to leave the food.
    </li>
    <li>
      The rider refuses to deliver the Item to you in accordance with section 8
      (Age Restricted Products).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="terms__subtitle">7. Cancellation</h2>
  <p class="terms__text">
    You may cancel an order without charge at any time before the Restaurant
    Partner has started preparing the food (a "Started Order"). If you wish to
    cancel an order before it becomes a Started Order, please contact us
    immediately, via our Application. If the Partner Restaurant confirms the
    order was not a Started Order, we will refund your payment (excluding any
    discount, or Voucher that was applied to the order - see Voucher and Account
    Credit Terms for more detail). If you cancel any order after it becomes a
    Started Order, you will be charged the full price for the Items, and if the
    rider has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    Ready2Eat and the Partner Restaurant may notify you that an order has been
    cancelled at any time. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled by
    us or the Partner Restaurant, and we will reimburse you for any payment
    already made using the same method you used to pay for your order. We may
    also apply credit to your account to reflect the inconvenience caused.
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    For Items that are likely to deteriorate or expire rapidly, they cannot
    benefit from the right of withdrawal, in accordance with the provisions of
    Section 107 of the Consumer Rights Act 2022.
  </p>
  <p class="terms__text">
    If you buy a non-perishable Item from one of our Partners, they will provide
    you with all the information allowing you to exercise your right of
    withdrawal from the Order within fourteen (14) days of the date of your
    Order.
